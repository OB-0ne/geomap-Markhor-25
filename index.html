                            <h2>Mapping 2025 Pahalgam terror attack and the war that followed</h2>
                            <p>Approximately 2 weeks after the terror attacks, Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on 7th May targeting terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK). This was followed by a retaliatory attacks between the countries in form of drone, missiles and artillery shelling. A ceasefire was agreed upon 10th May, but the days in between were covered in fog of war and misinformation. <u>This interactive map presents verified strike locations, offering a geopolitical view of the events.</u></p>
                            <p>The map has defined borders for India, Pakistan, and PoK. These have been interpolated by using <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/"  target="_blank">Natural Earthâ€™s Countries point-of-views</a> database, which shows how a country sees other countries. The defined PoK is how the world views this geographical region. More details on the data analysis can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/OB-0ne/geomap-Markhor-25" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
                            <p>All the locations depicting attacks use approximate co-ordinates to show cities/regions affected, but not the actual site of attacks. These have been collected from various news media sources including media briefings by the government of India. They have been verified with an article posted by <a href="https://thewire.in/security/complete-chronology-full-list-of-attacks-india-pakistan" target="_blank">The Wire</a>.</p>
